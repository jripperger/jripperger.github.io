<h3>This post references Chapter 2: <i>A Pragmatic Approach</i></h3>

<p>In this chapter, the two topics that was were significant to me were "Orthogonality" and "Reversibility". Orgthoganility
    is the notion that sections of code should be relatively independent of other code within the project. In other words, 
    changing aspects of one method should not drastically affect a whole set of methods. However, when coding, I inadvertently 
    fail to write orthogonal code; this usually causes problems at some point in my project. Thus, I eventually find myself 
    reviewing my code in order to make it more self-sufficient, which can take a long time and disrupt my workflow. This
    "maintenance" period is only extended when I realize that the way in which wrote the program is not easily reversed.

    Orthogonality is closely assosciated with the concept of reversibility. Reversibility refers to the ability for code to be efficiently altered at any point. For one's code to be
    reversible, it must also be orthogonal. Sections of code cannot be changed quickly if it impacts other code. Reversibility
    of code is a necessity, as no decision in project development is final; a project's requirements are likely to evolve over
    time. I must remember these two essential approaches to programming when I create my next project. Reading this chapter has 
    reinforced my belief that problems in a programmer's methodology are the most crucial to rectify. Ultimately, coding is not 
    that difficult; problem solving in an efficient manner defines a good programmer.
